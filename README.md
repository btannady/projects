A list of some of my significant projects.

<h2 id="biometrics">"Biometric Wearables Pipeline" | Elderly Heart Rate & Accelerometer Surveillance</h2>
Kin-Keepers | Software Engineer Intern | Summer 2020
<br />
<br />
This was the project I undertook during my Summer 2020 internship that spanned several months in length. During this time, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern for a company called Kin-Keepers. This company specializes in creating different services and technological tools aimed in supporting the elderly community. Within those several months, I created embedded software in Bash/Python for the Biometrics IoT Integration team. The project's goal was to successfully grant our company AI a secure, stable, and wireless pipeline, capable of obtaining elderly heart rate and movement detection data wirelessly over Bluetooth LE signals. Relevant hardware involved were primarily lightweight and wearable devices capable of transmitting biometric data in real-time (e.g. smartwatch).
<br />
<br />
Considering the principles behind the wireless Bluetooth 4.0 stack were still unfamiliar to everyone in our company, I was tasked with pioneering and orchestrating the proof of concept for integrating GATT server/client interactions into our company's internal software. As a result, my work involved both a great deal of programming, and a substantial amount of my time was also spent self-learning to spearhead industry-level infrastructures into our company software. 
<br />
By the end of the summer, all project goals were favorably surpassed and accomplished. 
<br />
Through this learning experience, I cultivated an operational API pipeline capable of obtaining, handling, and streamlining data directly to the Kin-Keepers's 'PET' voice assistant AI to alert of potential incidents (involving our elderly clients) to prevent escalation of disasterous events.
Project development was fostered under the Agile SCRUM workflow, where we’d have daily standup meetings, sprint reviews, refinement sessions, and so on.
<br />
<br />
Made with Python, BlueZ (Bluepy), Atlassian Jira, PlanITpoker, EasyRetro.

<h2 id="discordBot">"Scouter Buddy" | Discord Multi-tool Bot</h2>
Developed in Python using open-source API, the bot imitates a humanistic persona while assisting Discord servers in gaining additional access to enhanced music, chat moderator, and gameplay tools. 
<br />
<h6>Music tool</h6> Users can command bot to join voice call channels within the server and automatically play their queued list of music.
<br />
<h6>Chat Moderator tool</h6> With permission, users are able to activate bot to detect, censor, and record, any messages sent by other users within the Discord chatroom.
<br />
<h6>Competitive Gameplay tools</h6> This feature is meant to act as a competitive gameplay software tool for League of Legends players. Users are given the ability to quickly search up previous performance history of teammates and opponents in real-time, allowing players to make improved strategic decisions based on calculated statistics. 
<br />
Created using Riot Games Developer API to effectively track live gameplay statistics. Enormous stockpiles of data is transferred using JSON files and algorithmically arranged to effectively assist players in identifying statistically-proven strengths and weaknesses of their teammates and opponents. 
<br />
<h6>Minigame tools</h6> Users are able to gain access to a variety of small minigames. 
<br />
<br />
Made with Python, FFmpeg, Homebrew, and Riot Games Developer API.

<h2 id="data-science">"Per Capita Income of Food Business vs Health Inspection Performance" | Data Modeling</h2>
This was a data science project I developed over Python. It answers the research question of whether or not there is a correlation between the per capita income of North Carolina food businesses in respect to their health inspection score performance.
<br />
My reasoning for asking this question was that I figured poorer neighborhoods would likely be less sanitary than wealthier neighborhoods because they don't have as much of a money budget to spend on routine hygenic operations. This would therefore result in businesses located in poorer neighborhoods to more frequently receive a lower health inspection score compared to wealthier neighborhoods.
<br />
<br />
Made with Python.
<br />

<h2 id="garden-app">"The Garden App" | Plant Maintenance Web Application</h2>
A simple and clean web application that provides users, new and old to gardening, an easy platform to help them care for their garden plants. Created as a three person project team in UI/UX Interaction Design.
<br />
<br /> 
Our web application enables users a personalized gardening experience unique to each of their specific garden plant species. Various features within the application allow for diverse searching through built-in catalogs of different plants species within our database where users are able to quickly discover essential ‘need to know’ information regarding each unique plant. The web app similarly contains a real-time plant calendar to help notify users to keep track of their watering days. 
<br />
Maintaining plants can be hard, but it doesn't have to be!
<br />
<br />
Made with HTML/CSS, Node.js, and Adobe XD.


<h2 id="food-quest">"Food Quest" | Virtual Reality RPG</h2>
Created for the Nutrition XR division at UCSD's Virtual/Augmented Reality organization. Seven person project development team. 
<br />
Created using Unity3D, Blender, and SteamVR. The concept behind the game is to promote healthy eating through interactive yet educational gameplay. Players are sent on dangerous quests and adventures to go hunting for food monsters in a fictional VR environment. After collecting enough food ingredients to complete a recipe, players will then return to the village kitchen to manually cook all of their collected ingredients to prepare a healthy dish.
<br />
<br />
The project involved the use of Unity3D as the gaming engine to run C# code. I primarily focused on creating the 3D graphic models and assets used within the "Food Quest" game. Our team had a lot of fun showcasing our project development in several UC San Diego hosted exhibitions.
<br />

<h2 id="Next Up!">"Next Up!" | Customer Traffic-Flow Simulator</h2>
Repository: https://github.com/btannady/CustomerServiceSimulator
<br />
<br />
An independent programming project that utilizes the Poisson distribution model to systematically operate a minute-by-minute customer traffic-flow simulation.
<br />
<br />
Entities are visually displayed to represent the individual customers waiting in queue and being helped by available servers.
<br />
<br />
Made with C++.


<h2 id="pokedex">"Sinnoh Region Pokedex" | Pokemon Database Search Simulator</h2>
Repository: https://github.com/btannady/SinnohRegionPokedex
<br />
<br />
Created independently as a python solo project. This program contains a built-in database of every single pokemon from the Sinnoh Region. Users are able to quickly and swiftly parse through detailed information on every pokemon within the database.
