A list of my significant projects.

<h2 id="biometrics">"Biometric Bluetooth Smartwatches" | Elderly Heart Rate and Accelerometer Surveillance</h2>
Kin-Keepers | Software Engineer Intern | Summer 2020
<br />
<br />
This was the project I undertook during my Summer 2020 internship. During this time, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern for a senior health-tech startup named Kin-Keepers. This company specializes in creating different services and tools aimed in supporting the elderly community. 
<br />
Within these four months, I pioneered and created embedded networking software with Bash and Python for the Biometrics IoT Integration team. The project's goal was to successfully grant our company AI a secure, stable, and wireless pipeline, capable of obtaining elderly heart rate and movement detection data wirelessly over Bluetooth LE signals. The types of hardware involved were primarily lightweight and wearable devices, capable of transmitting biometric data in real-time (e.g. smartwatches).
<br />
<br />
As the principles behind the wireless Bluetooth stack were still unfamiliar to those in the Kin-Keepers startup, I was tasked with generating the proof of concept for integrating the Bluetooth (GATT server/client interactions) into our company's internal software. As a result, my work involved both a great deal of programming, and a substantial amount of effort was dedicated towards self-learning to spearhead industry-level networking infrastructures for other engineering teams. 
<br />
<br />
By the end of the summer, all project goals were favorably surpassed and accomplished. Through this learning experience, our API pipeline grew capable of obtaining, handling, and streamlining data directly to the Kin-Keepers's 'PET' voice assistant AI to alert of potential life-concerning incidents (involving our elderly clients) and prevent escalation of such events.
Project development was fostered under the Agile SCRUM workflow, where we’d have daily standup meetings, sprint reviews, refinement sessions, and so on.
<br />
<br />
Made with Python, Linux OS/ Bash, Bluetooth 4.0.

<h2 id="discordBot">"MEGUMIN" | Discord Server Bot</h2>
Find out more in the repository page here: https://github.com/btannady/discord-bot
<br />
(Note: This repository possesses a modified API security token.)
<br />
<br />
Developed in Python using open-source APIs, the bot roleplays a fun persona while assisting Discord servers in accessing additional music control, chat moderator, and gameplay tools. 
<br />
<h6>Music Control tools</h6> Users can command bot to join server voice channels as an entity and automatically play through listed music queues.
<br />
<h6>Chat Moderator tools</h6> Permitted users are able to use bot to detect, censor, and/or record published user messages within the Discord chatroom.
<br />
<h6>Minigame tools</h6> Users are able to gain access to a variety of small minigames. 
<br />
<h6>Competitive Gameplay tools</h6> This feature acts as a competitive gameplay software tool for League of Legends players. 
<br />
Users are given the ability to quickly search up previous performance history of teammates and opponents in real-time, allowing players to make improved strategic decisions based on calculated statistics. Created using Riot Games Developer API to track live gameplay statistics. 
<br />
Player data is transferred using JSON files and algorithmically arranged to effectively assist players in identifying statistically-proven strengths and weaknesses of their teammates and opponents. 
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Made with Python, FFmpeg, Homebrew, and Riot Games Developer API.



<h2 id="garden-app">"The Garden App" | Plant Maintenance Web Application</h2>
Developed web application to provide users new and old to gardening an easy platform to maintain their garden plants. Created as a three person project team in UI/UX Interaction Design course.
<br />
<br /> 
This web application enables users a personalized gardening experience unique to each of their specific garden plant species. Various features within the application allow for diverse searching through built-in catalogs of different plants species within our database where users are able to quickly discover essential ‘need to know’ information regarding each unique plant. The web app similarly contains a real-time plant calendar to help notify users to keep track of their watering days. 
<br />
<br />
"Maintaining plants can be hard, but it doesn't have to be!"
<br />
<br />
Made with HTML/CSS, Node.js, and Adobe XD.

<h2 id="food-quest">"Food Quest" | Virtual Reality RPG</h2>
Repository: https://github.com/TritonXR/FoodQuest
<br />
<br />
Created for the Nutrition XR division at UCSD's Virtual/Augmented Reality organization, Triton XR. Seven person project development team. 
<br />
Created using Unity, Blender, and SteamVR. The concept behind the game is to promote healthy eating through interactive yet educational gameplay. Players are sent on dangerous quests and adventures to go hunting for food monsters in a fictional VR environment. After collecting enough food ingredients to complete a recipe, players will then return to the village kitchen to manually cook all of their collected ingredients to prepare a healthy dish.
<br />
<br />
Project backend used C# programming on top of Unity as the primary gaming engine platform. I also helped in creating 3D graphic assets used throughout the virtual game environment. Our team had a lot of fun showcasing our project development in several UC San Diego hosted exhibitions.
<br />
<br />

<h2 id="selenium-bot">"Bug Spotter" | Web Automation Testing</h2>
Developed in Python using open-source Selenium WebDriver, this automation testing project was crafted with the aim of evaluating website performance and maintaining quality assurance.
<br />
<br />
The project focuses on integrating fundamental principles of software testing, streamlining error checking procedures by following Page Object Model (POM) and the Unit Testing framework. After all tests have been run, an automated documentation of quality assurance reports are generated into HTML visualizations for straightforward and comprehensive analysis. 
<br />
<br />
Made with Python, Selenium, HtmlTestRunner.
<br />

<h2 id="data-science">North Carolina Data Modeling Study</h2>
This data science project was developed with Python, answering the research question of whether or not there is a correlation between per capita income of North Carolina food businesses in respect to their health inspection score performance.
<br />
<br />
Is it likely poorer neighborhoods are less sanitary than wealthier neighborhoods because they don't have as much of a money budget to spend on routine hygenic operations? Maybe this would lead businesses located within poor neighborhoods to frequently receive a lower health inspection score compared to wealthier neighborhoods. 
<br />
<br />
Made with Python.
<br />
