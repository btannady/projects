A list of some of my significant projects.


<h2 id="biometrics">"Biometric Wearables Pipeline" | Elderly Heart Rate & Movement Surveillance</h2>
Kin-Keepers | Software Engineer Intern | Summer 2020
<br />
<br />
Without giving away too much information, this was the project I undertook during my Summer 2020 internship that spanned several months in length. Although my work involved establishing a great deal of programming, a lot of my time was also spent pioneering and modernizing industry-level infrastructures into our company software. During my time at Kin-Keepers, I created surveillance software for the Biometrics IoT Integration team. The project's goal was to successfully grant our company AI a secure, stable, and wireless pipeline, capable of probing wearable devices (in real-time) for elderly heart rate and accelerometer movement detection data over Bluetooth LE signals.
<br />
Considering the principles behind BLE protocol integration were still unfamiliar to our team, I was tasked with spearheading and orchestrating the proof of concept for integrating GATT server/client interactions into our company's internal software.
Likewise, all project goals were favorably surpassed and accomplished by the end of the Summer internship. And with that, we had cultivated an established API pipeline involved with automated sensory activation, handling of biometric readings, and mobilizing streamlined alerts to the Kin-Keepers 'PET' voice assistant AI regarding potential elderly incidents before they escalate any further.
<br />
<br />
Made with Python, BlueZ (Bluepy), Jira.

<h2 id="food-quest">"Food Quest" | Virtual Reality RPG</h2>
Created for the Nutrition XR division at UCSD's Virtual/Augmented Reality organization. Seven person project development team. 
<br />
Created using Unity3D, Blender, and SteamVR. The concept behind the game is to promote healthy eating through interactive yet educational gameplay. Players are sent on dangerous quests and adventures to go hunting for food monsters in a fictional VR environment. After collecting enough food ingredients to complete a recipe, players will then return to the village kitchen to manually cook all of their collected ingredients to prepare a healthy dish.
<br />
<br />
The project involved the use of Unity3D as the gaming engine to run C# code. I primarily focused on creating the 3D graphic models and assets used within the "Food Quest" game. Our team had a lot of fun showcasing our project development in several UC San Diego hosted exhibitions.

<h2 id="garden-app">"Garden App" | Plant Maintenance Web Application</h2>
A simple and clean web application that provides users, new and old to gardening, an easy platform to help them care for their garden plants. Created as a three person project team in UI/UX Interaction Design.
<br />
<br /> 
Our web application enables users a personalized gardening experience unique to each of their specific garden plant species. Various features within the application allow for diverse searching through built-in catalogs of different plants species within our database where users are able to quickly discover essential ‘need to know’ information regarding each unique plant. The web app similarly contains a real-time plant calendar to help notify users to keep track of their watering days. 
<br />
Maintaining plants can be hard, but it doesn't have to be!
<br />
<br />
Made with HTML/CSS, Node.js, and Adobe XD.
<br />

<h2 id="statsTracker">"Scouter Buddy" | Real-time Statistics Tracking Program</h2>
Created using Riot Games Developer API to effectively track live gameplay statistics. Enormous stockpiles of data is transferred using JSON files and algorithmically arranged to effectively assist players in identifying statistically-proven strengths and weaknesses of their teammates and opponents. 
<br />
<br />
This program is meant to act as a competitive gameplay software tool for League of Legends players. Users of 'Scouter Buddy' are given the ability to quickly search up previous performance history of teammates and opponents in real-time, allowing players to make improved strategic decisions based on calculated statistics. 
<br />
<br />
Made with Python and Riot Games Developer API.

<h2 id="discordBot">"Mayushii" | Discord Multi-tool Music Bot</h2>
Capable of programmatically communicating within voice/chat group calls in Discord. The bot imitates a humanistic persona while assisting users with automonously playing music, proving support as a chat log tool, and storing user data for customized features.
<br />
<br />
Created using FFmpeg, Homebrew, Python. 


<h2 id="server up!">"Server Up!" | Customer Traffic-Flow Simulator</h2>
Repository: https://github.com/btannady/CustomerServiceSimulator
<br />
<br />
An independent programming project that utilizes the Poisson distribution model to systematically operate a minute-by-minute customer traffic-flow simulation.
<br />
<br />
Entities are visually displayed to represent the individual customers waiting in queue and being helped by available servers.
<br />
<br />
Made with C++.


<h2 id="pokedex">"Sinnoh Region Pokedex" | Pokemon Database Search Simulator</h2>
Repository: https://github.com/btannady/SinnohRegionPokedex
<br />
<br />
Created independently as a python solo project. This program contains a built-in database of every single pokemon from the Sinnoh Region. Users are able to quickly and swiftly parse through detailed information on every pokemon within the database.
